# TheRealist

A todo list created as a project for the Odin Project. 

This is currently a work in progress. I took some time off from this project due to different demands from school. I also was quite intimidated with the PubSub design pattern as it is relatively new to me. 

My plan is to finish the app using vanilla Javascript and then port it over to Electron as a way to work on building cross platform apps.



I created this designs for the app in Figma. Trying to test my design skills as well.
